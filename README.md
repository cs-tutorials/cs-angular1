Code School's 'Shaping Up with Angular' tutorial practice project

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a>

Their (free) Intro to Angular.js tutorial, <a target="_blank" href="http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/intro">Shaping Up With Angular</a>

So, I'm working my way through this tutorial, but also building an actual working version of the website that you mock-build in the tutorial.

Note that the tutorial has multiple, slightly different versions of the site at various stages (and particularly notable differences between the tutorial video versions and the actual hands-on practice versions) ... so the site in this GitHub project is my own composite mish-mash of their mock site (which does, in fact, produce a working Angular website, if you wire in the dependencies correctly).
